# Sales Insights (Interactive Dashboard Creation using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data and provide insights into market performance, customer contribution, and product trends.  
The dashboard enables stakeholders to identify which markets, products, and customers are driving revenue and sales quantity, helping them make data-driven decisions to improve business growth across different years.
## Dataset Used : 
  [Dataset](https://github.com/GOWRISANKAR16/PowerBI_Sales_Insights/blob/main/db_dump.sql)
## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total revenue and sales quantity for the selected time period?
- Which markets generate the highest revenue and sales?
- What is the revenue trend across different months?
- Who are the top 5 customers by revenue contribution?
- What are the top 5 products sold?

## Dashboard Interaction
The dashboard provides the ability to filter by:
- Year (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)
- Month (January, February, March, etc.)

This allows users to dynamically analyze revenue and sales across different time periods.
## Process
1. Verified and cleaned raw data for any missing values and inconsistencies.  
2. Ensured proper formatting of numerical fields (Revenue, Sales Quantity).  
3. Built key performance indicators (KPIs) for revenue and sales quantity.  
4. Created visualizations for:  
   - Revenue by Market  
   - Sales Quantity by Market  
   - Revenue Trend (by month)  
   - Top 5 Customers  
   - Top 5 Products  
5. Combined all visuals into an interactive dashboard with slicers for year and month.

## Project Insights
- Total Revenue: 7.28M | Total Sales Quantity: 16K in 2018.
- Delhi NCR is the leading market, contributing the highest revenue (3.5M) and sales quantity (0.0054M).
- Peak revenue occurred in June 2018 (~1.9M), while September saw the lowest.
- Electricalsara Stores is the top customer (3.0M contribution).
- The top-selling product contributed 4.6M revenue.
- Other products (Prod159, Prod102, Prod053, Prod060) individually contribute less than 0.2M each.
## Final Conclusion
Most sales come from Delhi NCR and a few top customers like Electricalsara Stores. To grow further, the business should focus on strengthening key markets and customers, expand sales in smaller markets, and promote a wider range of products instead of relying heavily on one category.
